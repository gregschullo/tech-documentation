**OKRs** - Objectives and Key Results  
OKRs are collaborative goal-setting protocols for companies, teams, and individuals.
 
## Chapter 1 - Google, Meet OKRs

If you don't know where you're going, you might never get there. -Yogi Berra

Ideas are easy, execution is everything.

Objective - What needs to be achieved.  
Objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational.

Key Results - Benchmark and monitor how to get to the objective.  
Key results are specific and time bound and aggressive, yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable.  
"It's not a key result unless it has a number."

You either meet a key result's requirements or you don't. There is no grey area or room for doubt.  

"Hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals and "specific hard goals" produce a higher level of output than vaguely worded goals.  

**scale** - big, systematic ways of looking a things done in a way that's reproducible.

Rule of Seven  
Many companies have a "rule of seven," limiting managers to a maximum of seven direct reports. Google has flipped this in some cases to a minimum of seven direct reports. This flattens the org chart, reduced top-down oversight, and creates greater frontline autonomy.  

### OKR Superpowers

1. Focus and Commit to Priorities
    - High-performing organizations focus in on work that is important and are equally clear on what doesn't matter. OKRs give the focus needed to win.
1. Align and Connect for Teamwork
    - OKR transparency, everyone's (from the CEO down) goals are openly shared. OKRs deepen people's sense of ownership and foster engagement and innovation.  
1. Track for Accountability
    - OKRs are driven by data. They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment.
1. Stretch for Amazing
    - OKRs motivate us to excel by doing more than thought possible. By testing limits and affording the freedom to fail, they release the most creative, ambitious self.

CFR - Conversation, Feedback, and Recognition.  
The failings of annual performance reviews have sparked a robust alternative - continuous performance management.

## Chapter 2 - The Father of OKRs

Andy Grove

It almost doesn't matter what you know. It's what you can do with whatever you do know and what you can acquire and actually accomplish.  
This gives affirmation of accomplishment over credentials.  

## Chapter 3 - Operation Crush: An Intel Story

Intel used OKRs to quickly change the focus of their large company.  

## Chapter 4 - Superpower #1: Focus and Commitment to Priorities

Measuring what matters beings with the question: What is most important in the next three (or six or twelve months)?

Wrong decisions can be corrected once results begin to roll in. Non-decisions or decisions that are abandoned too quickly teach us nothing.

"Don't allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good."

Key Results should be succinct, specific, and measurable. A mix of outputs and inputs is helpful. Completion of all key results **must** result in attainment of the objective. If not, it's not an OKR.

### Less is More

Innovation means saying no to a thousand things. In most cases, the ideal number of quarterly OKRs will range between three and five.  
It is tempting to create more, but too many OKRs can blur focus on what counts most.  
"If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing."

"The art of management lies in the capacity to select the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them." - Andy Grove

"Put more wood behind fewer arrows" - Larry Page
